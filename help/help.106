	*perm [o|c|t] [name|d|exit] [timeout|slot]

This command allows DMs to make a monster or an item permanent in the
parent room.  You may also use this command to delete objects or creatures
from the perm list for a room, as well as set the timeout value.  
The timeout value is the time in seconds that it will take before the permed
object or creature will return after leaving the room. 
  In addition, you can use this command to place permanent tracks leading 
out a specified exit

examples
:*perm o d 1

leather armor permed with timeout of 1300.  
:*perm c wiz 19900

"*perm t north
