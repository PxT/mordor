	FLEE
	RUN

The flee command is a fool-proof way to escape a room when monsters have
been attacking you and are really starting to hurt you.  With some monsters
flee is unnecessary (because they do not attempt to block exits).  But
other monsters block exits, and you may be forced to flee to save your
life.  Any weapon which you had wielded is dropped in the room you fled 
from.
