Help on:
	ATTACK <player/monster> [#]
	KILL <player/monster> [#]

The attack command allows a player to fight a monster or player who is
in the same room.  Once a monster is attacked, it will remember your
face until it's dead, so don't make too many enemies at once.  If you
do not supply a numeric modifier to the monster's name and there are more
than one of that monster in the room, then you will be assumed to be 
attacking the first such monster in the room.  As additional monsters
are added to the room, they will be given larger identifying numbers,
so you can assume that the numeric identifier you chose to begin with
will not change.

IMPORTANT:  Combat in Isengard is not like combat in many other MUDs where
you type kill <monster> once and sit back and yawn.  You must continue to
attack the monster you're fighting. 

Example:

You see two hobbits.
: k hob 2
You attack the hobbit.
You hit for 5 damage.
