	TURN <monster> [#]

Turn is a special ability that is given to paladins and clerics.  When
attacking undead creatures (like ghosts, vampires, etc.) a cleric or
paladin may try to turn a monster.  If successful, the monster is stripped
of half its hit points or possibly even killed instantly.  This is a 
powerful weapon.  Success depends on the difference in levels between
the player and monster as well as piety.
