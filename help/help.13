Wield allows you to wield a weapon of some sort, as long as you are not
already wielding one.  If you have proficiency in the type of weapon you
are wielding, you will hit an opponent more frequently.

Example:

: inventory
You have a small bow, a long bow, a small ash bow.
: wield bow 3
You wield a small ash bow.
