	*add [r|c|o] [#]

This creates a new room in the database, or a new creature or object for
editing.  A number must be specified when creating a new room, while
creatures and objects will arrive in your room or inventory, respectively. 

NOTE: Rooms are automatically added to the database, whereas creatures
and objects must be saved after completion using the *save command. 

example:
:*add r 4123
Room #4123 created
:*add c
A clay form just arrived.
Creature created.
:*add o
Generic item added to your inventory.
