	CIRCLE <player/monster> [#]

The circle command allows fighters and barbarians to run circles about an
opponent, causing them to be confused for several seconds.  Any monster
that is circled will not be able to attack back for a few seconds, giving
you a slight defensive advantage.  Circle is most useful in groups.
