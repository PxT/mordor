	PREPARE

The prepare command is used when you know the next room you're going to
walk into has a trap in it.  If you prepare before entering a room,
you will almost always avoid any trap in that room (unless your
dexterity is really poor).  Prepare only lasts until you enter the 
next room, and you can only use it once every 15 seconds.
