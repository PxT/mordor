	IGNORE [player]

The ignore command allows you to ignore flashes (sends, tells) from
other players in the game.  If typed without an argument, the
list of people you are ignoring will be displayed.  If typed with
a player's name, that player will be added to your ignore list if
he or she is not already on it.  Otherwise the name is removed from
the list.
