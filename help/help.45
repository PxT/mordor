	BACKSTAB <monster/player> [#]

The backstab command is usable only by thieves and assassins, and allows
them to do 2-3 times more damage than normal with sharp or thrusting
weapons.  The thief or assassin must be hidden in order for a backstab
to work, and if he or she fails, then they are considered vulnerable
and will have to wait 3 times the normal amount of time before attacking
again.  Backstab can only be used to initiate combat, not once the
monster is already attacking you.
