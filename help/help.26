	HIDE [<object> [#]]

The hide command allows you to hide yourself or objects that are in the 
room.  If you type hide by itself, you will attempt to hide in the shadows
to prevent other players or monsters from seeing you in the room.  You
can also attempt to hide any object that is sitting on the room's floor,
and if you are successful the object will not be visible to anyone who
does not search for it.  Rangers, thieves and assassins hide best.

Example:

On the floor you see: a small knife, a bag.
: hide knife
You attempt to hide the knife.
: look
On the floor you see: a bag.
: hide
You attempt to hide in the shadows.
