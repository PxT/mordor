	HOLD <object> [#]

Hold allows you to hold certain objects that are designated as "hold-able"
items.  Things like torches, lanterns and wands are all hold-able.  Anything
that you are holding, wearing or wielding cannot be stolen.  Certain things
have to be held for them to have any use (for example torches).

Example:

: hold torch 2
You hold the torch.
