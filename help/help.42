	BUY <object> [#]

If you are in a shoppe, you may purchase an item for sale with the buy
command.  First use the LIST command to see what is for sale, and then
purchase it with this command.  Please note that when you use the buy
command only the word that directly follows it is interpreted, so if
you typed "buy leather boots," it would not care what followed the word
"leather."  This could cause you pain if there were several leather items
for sale, because "buy leather" will buy you the first leather item on
the list.  To avoid this problem, either use "buy boots" or "buy leather 2"
where leather boots is the second leather item for sale.

Example:
: list
You may buy:
   A leather hat       Cost: 3
   A cloth hat         Cost: 2
   Some leather boots  Cost: 10
: buy leather 2
You bought some leather boots.
