Help on:
	CAST <spell> [on] [<player/monster/object> [#]]

The cast command allows you to cast spells which you may have learned
by STUDYing scrolls.  The INFO command will tell you which spells you
currently know.  Different spells cost different amounts of magic points.
When you cast a spell, the magic points are subtracted, and the special
magic effect is produced.  Unlike other MUDs, this one allows all classes 
to cast spells.  Of course, some classes get more magic points than others.
To cast a spell on yourself, do not include a target.

Example:

: cast vigor
You cast a vigor spell on yourself.
