Mordor Database Utility and Utility Library v1.0 
	(c) 1996 Brooke Paul
---------------------------------------------------------

  This package contains a Database checking and fixing utility for use
with Mordor MUD databases.  It reads each room in turn and checks for
improperly permed creatures and objects.  If any are found then they are
permed properly in the room.  If a unique creature or object is found it
is given a slot in the database of and permed properly into its parent
room. 
  The utils.c and utils.h files are general utilities for accessing 
and saving to Mordor MUD database files.  This utility package can be 
used to write custom applications for the analysis and modification of the 
database.
  We believe this utility package to be bug free, but recommend that you 
BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE USING THESE UTILITIES.  You have been warned.

  To compile:

	1.  Examine the options at the top of ckdb.c
	2.  Be sure your header files are in ../../src.
	3.  Be sure that the utils header and source are in ../lib.
	4.  Compile chkdb:
		make
		or
		cc -g utils.c ckdb.c -o chkdb

  This will give you a program named chkdb.  A binary of this program is 
provided for Linux.  It was compiled on 2.0.29 ELF.  You will need about 
8M free memory to run this on a medium sized database (~5K rooms).
