				RAGNAR'S COVENANT

		This covenant is between the undersigned and Ragnar,
		Prince of the Realm, Lord of the Chrysanthemum,
		Defender of the Faith, Master of the Occult, and
		the only true heir to the throne at Lyanden Castle.

		Ragnar hereby recognizes you as a famous warrior,
		one who is independent and allowed to be a captain
		unto himself.  For your fealty, and promise to help
		vanquish the unclean forces of Rutger, second born
		to King Lyanden, Ragnar will give you all the rights
		and privileges of the highest born in his realm.

		You may kill with impunity all those who have pledged
		allegiance to Rutger, and no court will hold you liable.
		You may take of their inventory, and of their armor
		and weapons, and no man may say nay.

		Any warrior who takes this covenant, and finds and
		kills Rutger, will be elevated in level and will rule
		below my right hand.  As God is my witness.
							-- Ragnar
